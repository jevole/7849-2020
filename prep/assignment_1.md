# Assignment 1

# Installing Python

Please follow installation instructions from this tutorial: [https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-windows-anaconda-c63c7c3d1444](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-python-on-windows-anaconda-c63c7c3d1444). Download version 3 of Python (not version 2) at [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Make sure to select the right operating system ('Windows' or 'macOS').

It is easiest to select 'Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable' in step 2 (this will allow you to run Python from any folder on your computer, and allow easier access to the python installation package manager - pip).
 
The 'Anaconda' version of Python contains everything you need to run Python code, and it also contains 'Jupyter notebook'. This allows you to organize/run Python code on your computer through a web page. 

# Tutorials to review

Make sure you have reviewed the following topics before starting to work on this assignment.

## Required

Write a Python program that asks for user input (ask the user to enter their age), and then offer an alcoholic beverage of your choice or apple juice depending on the user's age. Let the user input the beverage, and print a message to confirm ('You will be drinking XXXX', or 'You will be drinking apple juice').

Your program needs to reject the user's input if the user does not enter a number. Note, you may have to convert the user's input to an integer (int) using the `int` function. 

See [https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp) for an example to get user input.


Please submit your python code along with the output of the program. (In Jupyter Notebook, click 'File', 'Download as', 'HTML')

# Use web resources

There are lots of resources on the web to help getting Python to do what you want. Use Google to search for queries like 'Python input number', or 'Python test for equality'.
